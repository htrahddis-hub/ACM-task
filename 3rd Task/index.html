                <p  style="color: black; background-color: beige; opacity: 0.8;">No matter what the situation, pizza always helps. Especially a pizza that gives you the freedom to choose your toppings - from paneer, crisp capsicum, onion, grilled mushroom, golden corn, black olives, fresh tomato, red paprika, jalapeno, paneer tikka and extra cheese to non-veg toppings such as pepper barbeque chicken, peri-peri chicken, grilled chicken rasher, chicken sausage or chicken tikka- the options are almost endless, anything and everything you can think of that too on top of the crust of your choice - New hand-tossed crust, wheat thin crust, cheese burst crust, classic hand-tossed crust or a fresh pan pizza. Because just like a pizza, Domino's understands you.</p>
